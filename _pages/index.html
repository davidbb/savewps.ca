    <h1>OCDSB Elementary Program Review</h1>
    In April 2024, the OCDSB began the development of a plan for improving the quality and access to programs it offers, citing concerns such as program availability, limited access to French Immersion, and inconsistent supports for special education. The full proposal can be <a href="https://engage.ocdsb.ca/elementary-program-review" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">read here</a> <br/>. 
    
    <h1>School Boundary Changes</h1>
    10 months into the proposal development, and less than 2 months before the Trustee vote on the proposal, OCDSB released their proposed attendance boundaries, grade configurations and program offerings under the new model (see <a href="https://hdp-ca-prod-app-ocdsb-engage-files.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/6317/4075/9574/Appendix_A_to_Report_25-016__-_Summary_of_Proposed_Changes_by_School.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report apprendix</a>). 

    Under the new model, WPS goes from offering JK - grade 8 education to offering grades 4-8. Moreover, the new school boundaries displace students currently enrolled at WPS (in grades JK-3) to Regina Street Alternative. For families in Carlingwood and Wood Park, this would require walking up to 3 km (35+ mins).
